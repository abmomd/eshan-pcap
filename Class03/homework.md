Homework – Python Programming (PCAP Aligned: Stack & OOP)

1. Write a Python program to implement a stack using a list (procedural approach).
   The program should support the following operations:
   - push
   - pop
   - peek
   - check if the stack is empty

2. Write a Python program to show the problem of data insecurity in a procedural stack
   by directly modifying the global stack list outside the push and pop functions.

3. Write a Python class `Stack` that uses a private list to store stack elements.
   Implement the following methods:
   - push
   - pop
   - peek
   - is_empty

4. Explain the difference between object creation and object initialization using code.
   Write a class `Book` with attributes `title` and `price` and create one object of the class.

5. Write a Python program to demonstrate how the `__init__()` method is automatically
   called during object creation.

6. Write a Python program to demonstrate name mangling by accessing a private variable
   of a class using `_ClassName__variableName`.

7. Write a Python class `BankAccount` with a private variable `balance`.
   Implement methods:
   - deposit(amount)
   - withdraw(amount)
   - get_balance()
   Ensure balance cannot be modified directly.

8. Write a Python program to reverse a string using a stack implemented as a class.
